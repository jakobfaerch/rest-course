To run the project on an embedded Glassfish app server,
make sure nothing else i listening on port 8080
(on Mac/Linux run 'lsof -i :8080' in a terminal)
Then run the command
mvn install embedded-glassfish:run

to produce .classpath and .project files for Eclipse, run
mvn eclipse:eclipse
and afterwards open the .project file from within Eclipse

You need a classpath variable in Eclipse named M2_REPO to point at the repository folder inside your .m2 repository. 
Some Eclipse distributions have this by default, some don't.

Go to
http://localhost:8080/rest-server/myresource
in a browser and verify that the text "Jersey is working" is shown.
